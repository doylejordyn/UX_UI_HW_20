  <p class="leadOne">The goal for this project was to create a travel app for the post-pandemic world. 
    Travelling is going to look very different once COVID-19 settles down, and people are going to be more concerned 
    than ever about  knowing  health and safety information & statistics before they book.  Our solution was to create 
    an app that allows them to keep track of that information while booking their trip! With our app they can book their 
    hotel and see up-to-date COVID-19 statistics for the area all at once. Allowing them to travel in peace. </p>
 
</div>


<div class="jumbotronPlanning">
  <p class="lead">In designing this app one of the most important things for us 
    to understand was what potential fears, and concerns users would have travelling post-pandemic. 
    We spoke to a wide range of interviewees about these concerns used the information they gave us as a guide for  
    our next steps. After that, designing and iterating the app that you see above came very easily.

 <div class="jumbotronResearch">
  <p class="lead">Once we interviewed our group, we sorted all of their answers into categories. 
    This would help us find any differences and  similarities in their answers.
<br>           
    After our first round of sorting we began ideating based on our findings, then sorted them again. 
    First we  sorted them based on what the users liked, wished for, and their ideas, then we moved these notes 
    into a Feature Prioritization Matrix. As the name suggests, this step is to help us prioritize our users wants and needs.
    
  </p>

 <div class="jumbotronWf">
    <p class="lead">The user interviews gave us a lot of useful information about what our users wanted and needed. 
      From there I was able to develop a user flow, which informed what pages needed to be developed, 
      so all I had to do here was create rough versions of them.

<div class="jumbotronTesting">
      <p class="lead">After developing and linking the  wireframes, I had to test the flow with users. Again, I sorted all of the 
        findings into a prioritization matrix and made iterations to the final design based on their importance. 
      </p>
     
    </div>
  

    <div class="jumbotronPrototypes">
      <p class="lead">  Based on the feedback of the Guerrilla Tests, 
        I then went to work on creating the final drafts of the wireframes, 
        and turned those into a workable prototype.
